I have followed and attended many competitions over the years which allowed me to notice a shift in sport with the prominence of quadruple jumps in single skating. Quadruple jumps have become a standard in men's figure skating and even have made it into the women's discipline which was unprecedented before.\n\n## About Figure Skating\n\nFigure skating is a sport in which individuals, pairs or groups perform a variety of elements on figure skates on ice. It was the first winter sport to be added to Olympics in 1908.\n\nIt comprises of four disciplines. Pairs skating, single skating, ice dance and synchronous skating. For the sake of this data story, we will be focusing on single skating. Single skating is comprised of the men's and women's discipline.\n\nA figure skating program has specific components that needs to be comprised. A certain amount of jumps, spins and other technical elements determine the quality and difficulty of a program. There are also two programs in competitive figure skating: short program and free skate. These two have two different lengths one being 2 mins 40 seconds while the free skate is 4 minutes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](fs.jpg){width=1200px height=675px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Scoring system\n\nThe figure skating scoring system is divided into two categories: technical and performance. The technical score evaluates the technical elements of a program such as jumps and spins. While the performance score, looks at the quality of the transitions on the ice and interpretation of the music.\n\nThese two scores are the added together to create a total score for the program.\n\n###Data set\n\nI will be utilizing a comprehensive data set encompassing the outcomes of various Olympic events. This data set will serve as a foundation for identifying medalists and assessing their scores. By doing so, I aim to draw comparisons between athletes who executed quadruple jumps in their routines and those who did not. This analysis will provide insights into the impact of quadruple jumps on overall scores, thereby aiding in the determination of their significance within the sport.\n\n***Olympic Results - Women's Figure Skating***\n\nThe following data set comprises the details and results for the past Winter Olympics in the Women's figure skating discipline.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output
