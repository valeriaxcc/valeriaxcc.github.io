**About this site**

This site is part of project for the class Computational Media Literacy at the National University of Singapore. As a figure skater, I have always been interested in the competitive scene. I have followed and attended many competitions over the years which allowed me to be aware of any changes in trends in the sport.

I have learned how to read scoring sheets and have found it to be an interesting data to analyze due to its intricacies and consistent changes throughout the years. Figure skating remains one of my biggest passions and so I chose to pursue this subject as a way to debunk any myths or conversations around inflated or unfair scoring.
